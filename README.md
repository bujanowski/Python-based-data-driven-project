## At what age do the Russians marry?
To find out, I look for data on Russian state resources.

⬜I took data from "Rosstat". Rosstat is the Federal State Statistics Service in Russia.

🔸I wanted to know, how many people got married in the recent years and whether there are new trends. I found some xls-files on this topic here - https://rosstat.gov.ru/folder/12781

❗The first problem was: after 2014 "Rosstat" counts Crimea as part of Russia. Crimea is internationally recognized as being part of Ukraine. I worked with this data, but it's important to mention that fact in the work.

〽To make a first chart, I opted for the numbers about the Russian women. With the help of Excel and Python I could show the trend whoch shows that less women under the age of 18 get married.
